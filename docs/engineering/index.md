# Engineering Overview

This section defines the engineering principles and standards for LCS.

## Principles

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Keep core logic independent from infrastructure.
- Favor explicit error handling over hidden control flow.
- Make behavior observable and measurable.

## Standards

See `docs/engineering/standards.md` for coding and architecture rules.
See `docs/engineering/guidelines/` for process guidance.
