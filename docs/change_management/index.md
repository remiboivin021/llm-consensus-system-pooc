# Change Management

Change management is critical to maintaining the stability and reliability of the LLM Consensus System. This section outlines the processes and policies for managing changes effectively.

## Change Control Process
- **Purpose**: Ensures that all changes are reviewed, tested, and approved before implementation.
- **Steps**:
  1. Submit a change request using the provided template.
  2. Conduct an impact analysis to assess risks and dependencies.
  3. Review and approve the change request.
  4. Implement the change in a controlled environment.
  5. Monitor the system for any issues post-implementation.

## Version Control Policy
- **Purpose**: Maintains a clear history of changes and facilitates collaboration.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Use feature branches for new functionality.
  - Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages.
  - Merge changes into the main branch only after passing all tests.

## Release Management
- **Purpose**: Ensures that new versions are deployed smoothly and with minimal disruption.
- **Practices**:
  - Use semantic versioning to label releases.
  - Maintain a detailed change log for each release.
  - Conduct thorough testing before deployment.

## Templates and Tools
- **Change Request Template**: Refer to `change_request_template.md` for the standard format.
- **Impact Analysis Template**: Use `impact_analysis_template.md` to evaluate risks and dependencies.
