# Release Management

## Process

1. Create a `release/*` branch from `develop`.
2. Stabilize and test.
3. Merge the release branch to `main`.
4. Tag the release commit with the semantic version.
5. Merge `main` back into `develop`.

## Changelog

A changelog will be maintained once releases begin.
