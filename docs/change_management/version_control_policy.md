# Version Control Policy

- Git Flow is used for branching.
- `main` is release-ready and protected.
- `develop` is the integration branch.
- Feature, release, and hotfix branches follow Git Flow conventions.

## Versioning

- Semantic versioning is used for releases.
- A release is created by tagging the commit on `main`.
- Tags define the official version.
